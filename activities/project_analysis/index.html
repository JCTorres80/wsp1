	<h2>Site Intent</h2>
	    <ul>
			<li><label>Original Site:</label> <a href="http://www.bestvetcharlotte.com/index.html">www.bestvetcharlotte.com</a></li>
			<li>Validation: Current Site has 28 Errors and 15 Warnings</li>
		</ul>
	<p>The website redesign objective for the St.Francis Animal Hospital is to reorganize the navigation menu, redraw and modernize the logo, 
	add a contact form, give it a new improved UI so its easier navigate. I recommend to remove all outdated CSS style from content and replace
	with with a new CSS style sheet, utilizing HTML tag classes and IDs to target content styling with CSS.</p>
	<p>The site needs eye catching info, better choices of color combinations for better, cleaner view, it needs to radiate a professional
	happy environment and clinic providing information and services to the client. Currently the visual design is weak accross all pages.
	I plan to break site apart, keeping some content and information. The website need new brighter images, the current images are dark, gloomy 
	and look boring. There is a link like text in white on the original site that links you to a blog. This needs to change a button or 
	place for better viewing. The page needs a contact page, by adding a contact page we can eliminate the store hours and view that is 
	redundant on every page. This needs to be on its own page.</p>
	<p>The site needs work and we will shoot for creating a cleaner organized site with good UI.</p>
